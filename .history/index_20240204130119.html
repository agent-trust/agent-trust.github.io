            <p>Large Language Model (LLM) agents have been increasingly adopted as simulation tools to model humans in applications such as social science. However, one fundamental question remains: <i>can LLM agents really simulate human behaviors?</i> In this paper, we focus on one of the most critical behaviors in human interactions, <i>trust</i>, and aim to investigate whether or not LLM agents can simulate human trust behaviors. We first find that LLM agents generally exhibit trust behaviors, referred to as <b><i>agent trust</i></b>, under the framework of <i>Trust Games</i>, which are widely recognized in behavioral economics. Then, we discover that LLM agents <i>can</i> have high <b><i>behavioral alignment</i></b> with humans regarding trust behaviors, indicating <i>the feasibility to simulate human trust behaviors with LLM agents</i>. In addition, we probe into the biases in agent trust and the differences in agent trust towards agents and humans. We also explore the intrinsic properties of agent trust under conditions including advanced reasoning strategies and external manipulations. We further offer important implications for various scenarios where trust is paramount. Our study represents a significant step in understanding the behaviors of LLM agents and the LLM-human analogy.

      <p>
        In our study, the trust game serves as a mechanism to validate the presence of trust behavior in Large Language Model (LLM) agents. By examining the amounts sent and the Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) outputs across various LLMs within the context of the trust game, we aim to ascertain the existence of trust behavior in LLM agents.

        <p>To evaluate the capacity of LLMs to comprehend basic experimental settings regarding money limits, we used the Valid Response Rate (VRR) as a metric. This metric measures the percentage of responses where the amount sent does not exceed the initial money limit of $10. Our findings reveal that most LLMs, with the notable exception of Llama-7b, demonstrate a high VRR. This indicates a comprehensive understanding among most LLMs of the limits within the Trust Game framework.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, the analysis of the amount sent by different LLMs acting as trustor agents showed all amounts to be positive, showcasing a level of trust. Additionally, the consistency observed between the reasoning process and the final decisions in Trust Games underscores the rationality of LLM agents to a certain extent.</p>
        <p>Given these observations, we highlight our core finding: </p>

        <p>In this section, we aim to explore the fundamental relationship between agent trust and human trust, i.e., whether or not agent trust aligns with human trust, which can provide important insights on the feasibility of utilizing LLM agents to simulate human trust behaviors as well as more complex human interactions. First, we propose a new concept <b><i>behavioral alignment</i></b> and discuss its differences compared to existing alignment definitions. Then, we conduct extensive studies to investigate whether or not LLM agents exhibit behavioral alignment with humans regarding trust behaviors.</p>

      <p>Since the LLM agents, especially GPT-4, show highly human-like <em>behavioral factors</em> and <em>patterns in behavioral dynamics</em>, we can have our second core finding:</p>
      <div class="grey-box">

      <div class="content has-text-justified">
        <br>
        <p><b>Gender Bias in Trust:</b> We find that LLM agents, including GPT-4, exhibit a tendency to send higher amounts of money to female players compared to male players (e.g., $7.5 vs. $6.7 for GPT-4), indicating a general bias towards placing higher trust in women. This observation suggests that LLM agents might be influenced by societal stereotypes and biases, aligning with other research findings that document similar gender-related biases in various models.</p>

        <p><b>Agent Trust Towards Humans vs. Agents:</b> Our study shows a clear preference of LLM agents for humans over fellow agents, exemplified by instances such as Vicuna-33b sending significantly more money to humans than to agents ($4.6 vs. $3.4). This finding underscores the potential for LLM-agent collaboration by highlighting a natural inclination of LLM agents to place more trust in humans, which could be beneficial in hybrid teams but also points to challenges in fostering cooperation between agents.</p>

        <p><b>Manipulating Agent Trust:</b> We investigate whether it is possible to explicitly manipulate the trust behaviors of LLM agents through direct instructions. The results reveal that while it is challenging to enhance trust through such means, most LLM agents can be directed to reduce their trust levels. For instance, applying the instruction "you must not trust the other player" led to a noticeable decrease in the amount sent by agents like text-davinci-003 from $5.9 to $4.6. This suggests that while boosting trust might be difficult, diminishing it is relatively easier, posing a potential risk of exploitation by malicious entities.</p>

        <p><b>Influence of Reasoning Strategies on Trust:</b> By implementing advanced reasoning strategies, such as the zero-shot Chain of Thought (CoT), we observe changes in the trust behavior of LLM agents. Although the impact varies across different LLMs, this demonstrates that reasoning strategies can indeed affect how trust is allocated. However, for some agents, like GPT-4, the application of zero-shot CoT did not significantly alter the amount sent, indicating that the effectiveness of reasoning strategies may be contingent on the specific characteristics of each LLM agent.</p>

        <p>Our findings on the intrinsic properties of agent trust lead to our third core finding:</p>
        <div class="grey-box">
          <p>LLM agents' trust behaviors have demographic biases, have a relative preference towards humans compared to agents, are easier to be undermined than to be enhanced, and can be influenced by  reasoning strategies.</p>
        </div>
        <p>This finding demonstrates the profound potential to utilize LLM agents, especially GPT-4, to simulate human trust behaviors embracing both <b>actions</b> and  underlying <b>reasoning processes</b>>, which paves the way for the simulation of more complex human interactions and society. Our finding also deepens the understanding of the fundamental analogy between LLMs and humans and opens doors to research on the LLM-human alignment beyond values.</p>

        <h2 class="title is-3">Implications of Agent Trust</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="content has-text-justified">
        <br>
          <p><b>Implications on Human Simulation</b>: Our findings highlight that LLM agents, particularly GPT-4, demonstrate a high degree of behavioral alignment with human trust behaviors, offering empirical evidence that key aspects of human interactions, such as trust, can be effectively simulated by LLM agents. This discovery paves the way for more accurate simulations of individual-level interactions and society-level social structures where trust plays a pivotal role. It opens up possibilities for discovering behavioral alignments in aspects beyond trust and developing methodologies to enhance these alignments for more nuanced human simulations.</p>
          <p><b>Implications on Agent Cooperation</b>: The study suggests that trust could be a crucial factor in enhancing cooperation among LLM agents, akin to its role in human society and Multi-Agent Systems. By understanding intrinsic properties of agent trust, as explored in our research, there's potential to design trust-dependent cooperation mechanisms. These insights could be instrumental in facilitating effective decision-making and problem-solving among agents, underscoring the importance of trust in developing sophisticated multi-agent cooperation frameworks.</p>
          <p><b>Implications on Human-Agent Collaboration</b>: Our research sheds light on the nuanced preferences of LLM agents in trusting humans over other agents and explores ways to enhance agent trust through direct instructions. This has implications for improving the efficiency and intuitiveness of human-agent collaborations, by leveraging the inherent trust dynamics to foster smoother interactions. Additionally, by highlighting demographic biases and other intrinsic properties of agent trust, we contribute to a deeper understanding of LLM agents among humans, potentially reducing over-reliance and fostering more successful collaborations.</p>
